For online advertising to work best, you need a network of websites large enough and diverse enough to include whatever audience you want to reach - our network of sites does just that.</p><p>You can precisely target your audience through geo-targeting location - locally, regionally or nationally. You can also refine this further by adding demographic requirements as well.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">I&#39;m trying to edit my ad - why aren&#39;t my changes taking effect?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>When you open your ad for editing, you must make the changes in a pop-up window.

Traditional advertising would mean appearing on billboards, at bus stops, in magazines and on TV. When you want to put your brand onto the web - you use display advertising.</p><p>Online display ads are exactly what the name implies - they are ads placed on websites by businesses like yours advertising your products or services. When a person clicks on your display ad they are then taken through to your website or landing page where they can find out more.</p><p>Localised display advertising is without a doubt the most cost-effective way to market your business online.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">If my monthly budget does not get used in any given month does it get rolled forward to the following month?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        Yes. Our display technology is designed to select and serve your advertising to the most targeted potential customers. &nbsp;However, if budget is consistently being unused then the geographic targeting may need to be expanded, or demographic and interest targeting widened if this has been selected.                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">How many images can my Display Ads have in them?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>Ads can feature between one to three images. There are always three image placeholders in the ad, so it is best to pick three great images that really show off the page, product or service that you want to promote.</p><p>If there are less than three images, the available images will repeat to complete the ad's three-image slideshow.

Reports will be broken down by day and summarized by ads viewed in a geographical area, clicks within a geographical area, ads viewed overall, ads clicked overall.</p><p>Analytics: The numerical data that is gathered by taking the number of times a specific advertisement was placed on web pages and comparing that to the number of times it was clicked.</p><p>Ads Viewed: The number of times an ad was seen by visitors to the web site showing the advertisement. Each visitor to the site triggers a showing of an advertisement and the total number of showings of that ad are referred to as the "impressions" that ad received.</p><p>Clicks: An interaction with (click on) a display advertisement that results in that user visiting your web page.</p><p>Campaign/Promotion: A group of advertisements that is comprised of similar creative assets and set to run within a specified budget and a specified time frame. It can also encompass specific publisher sites and targeting methods to be used for that group of advertisements.</p><p>Click-through: Same as "click": a user interacts with an advertisement and "clicks through" to the advertiser's web page.</p><p>Conversion: A click-through to an advertiser's web site that results in a sale of that web site's product. Conversion, or making a sale, is the overall goal and measure of success of most advertising campaigns.</p><p>Conversion rate: The percentage of users clicking through to an advertiser's web site that result in a sale of that web site's product. If 1,000 users click through to a web site and 10 of those users buy that site's product, the conversion rate is 10/1000, or .01 (1%).</p><p>CPC (Cost Per Click): An advertising pricing model that charges the advertiser every time one of their ads is clicked on.</p><p>CPM (Cost Per 1,000 Impressions): A pricing model based on a cost for every 1,000 times an ad is shown on publishers' web sites (M is the Roman numeral for 1,000). This cost model is usually associated with branding campaigns that are more interested in visibility and exposure than in click rates.</p><p>CTR (Click-Through Rate): The percentage of internet users that click an advertisement after seeing it shown on a web page. If an advertisement is shown 1000 times and 20 users click on it, the CTR is 20/1000, or .02 (2%).</p><p>Click URL: The web page or landing page people will be directed to when they click on your ad.</p><p>Display URL: The web address that is shown on your display ad.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">How can I make changes to my Display Advertising campaign?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>To make changes to your display advertising campaign, log into your account with your hibu business username and password.

We then place your ads on websites through our partner network to generate impressions for the ad campaign.  See below for an explanation of what an "impression" is. Each month you pay exactly the amount you set in your monthly budget, but any amount of the budget that is not spent on your campaign (because we haven't given you as many impressions as we targeted) in a given month will automatically roll over to be spent in the following month of the campaign.</p><p>Impressions are the measurement we use to count the number of times a display ad is displayed - each time an ad is displayed counts as one impression.  Your CPM (cost per thousand impressions) decreases the more you spend with Display Advertising.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">Why don&#39;t the images look very good in my ad?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>The patent-pending WebPageToAds technology we use attempts to find the best images on your page to illustrate your display advertising campaign. If your images aren't in the proper dimensions to fit in the ad, they can get cropped or resized. Unfortunately this can cause undesired effects.</p><p>The ad uses three images that are 360 pixels wide by 225 pixels high in size. If you have a photo editing program like Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, GIMP, or Microsoft Paint you can open the image you want to use in your ad and resize or crop it to 360 x 225 so that it fits perfectly in your ad. You can then upload the new image manually by clicking the 'upload more images' link and selecting 'My Drive'.</p><p>In addition, you can also select the 'Stock Library' link to search from millions of images to find the one that best represents your business. Lastly, click the 'My Website' link to enter the URL of another webpage on your site, and we'll fetch images from there.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">Does the Ad builder tool crawl my entire site?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>Our technology, called 'Smart Crawl' is designed to crawl all the image relevant pages i.e. galleries, photos, etc.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">How does Display Advertising work?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>Firstly, you enter the URL address of the website you want to advertise on your display ads.

Shopping Cart - Where you can position and set how your Cart will appear when requested<br />4.	Sale Confirmation - This page allows you to edit your confirmation message and title<p>As these pages have multiple layers you may need to double click at times and use the Editor drop down to locate the box, item or object you wish to edit.

Google Analytics is a free service that allows you to track and monitor activity on your site. You can sign up with Google who will give you a unique ID to attach to your site which will track user activity. From this you can see which are your most popular pages and how frequently people return, which sites your website was referred from, and many more metrics. There is a huge amount of very useful information available especially if you run campaigns or promotions.</p><p>To set up Google Analytics you must first log into the online stores product by clicking 'My Account', then 'My Products', and 'Manage my Store'. Once inside the online stores product, click on the Admin panel, then select the Statistics tab. Once the Statistics tab is open:</p><ol>	<li>Click on the 'Sign up for Google Analytics' button, which will open a new panel (Google Analytics) and then use the Get your Google ID button (N.B. If you already have a Google Analytics ID you can skip this and proceed to step 6).</li>	<li>You will then be taken to Google's own Analytics page where you can sign in to your Google Account (or register for one).</li>	<li>Sign up for Google Analytics (or sign in) - this will ask for your URL (website address), account name (something appropriate), and your time zone. N.B. This is another good reason to ensure that your domain name is set up to point to your website as this will ensure your statistics are more reliable.</li>	<li>Then, after providing your name, you'll have to accept Google's terms and conditions which will govern its operation.  We accept no responsibility for performance or non-performance of these tools.</li>	<li>You will then be presented with a code block containing your Google Analytics ID which you need to copy (to your clipboard).</li>	<li>Almost there! Go back to the Admin panel on your site (it should be still open in another window or tab) and paste the code block into the spacious ID field on the Analytics panel.</li>	<li>Click OK to save and then just be patient while Google begins to collect data about your site and your visitors.</li></ol>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">How do I set up a Paypal account on my online store?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>The payment gateway supported by Online Stores is PayPal Express Checkout.

When you upload images (or any files for that matter) they are saved in the File Manager as a source file.</p><p>You can access these source files from any page using the editor or toolbar to put, for example, images directly onto pages or in a gallery, or use as a background. You can delete or replace images on pages or in objects without affecting the source file. But the moment you delete the uploaded source file from the File Manager all references to that file on your site will be removed.</p><p>If you are concerned about file space on your site (or in your account) you have two options.</p><ol>	<li>You can upgrade your account to increase your storage;</li>	<li>You can make a habit of limiting the size of the files you upload to your site. For example image files do not need to be bigger than 200kb to ensure they display with suitable resolution on common screens and monitors. Anything bigger than 200kb will be wasted on most computer screens, and will slow down page loads, especially if you have several large images on one page.</li></ol>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">Can I edit my site? <span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>To edit your site:</p><ul><li>Login to your current site</li><li>Use Design on the toolbar</li><li>From the sidebar choose any of the options including Page Master, Body font, Background, Site alignment, Wallpaper and Icon</li><li>These options will allow you to change virtually the whole site elements</li><li>To change or edit or remove pages, simply use the Pages option on the toolbar then either add a page or organise the existing ones</li></ul>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">How does Google AdSense differ from Google AdWords?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>Google AdSense for Content is a means for you to earn money from your site by displaying relevant ads on your site.

For example they are used to remember usernames/passwords on many websites, preferences for country location or language, and they are critical for wishlists and shopping baskets when using an eCommerce site.</p><p>They are often used for analytics, i.e. to monitor visitor behaviour while on a website.

You can sign up with Google who will give you a unique ID to attach to your site which will track user activity. From this you can see which are your most popular pages and how frequently people return, which sites your website was referred from, and more. There is a huge amount of very useful information available especially if you run campaigns or promotions.</p><p>To set up Google Analytics you can click on the Admin panel, select the Statistics tab or use the Services icon on the toolbar and then the Setup button beside Google Analytics in the Sidebar.

Go back to the Admin panel on your site (it should be still open in another window or tab) and paste the code block into the spacious ID field on the Analytics panel.</li>	<li>Click OK to save and then just be patient while Google begins to collect data about your site and your visitors.</li></ol><p>Depending on how popular your website is, your stats may take a few hours to start collecting data, or it may take several days. There is a lot of detail and data - but the key stats for most users will be:</p><ul>	<li>Daily visitors (how many visitors and what percentage are new)</li>	<li>Visits and Page View Tracking (the number of visits which is distinct from your visitors)</li>	<li>Content Drilldown (the popularity of each page on your site)</li></ul><p>Google's Help section is extensive, so spend some time understanding the stats and you'll have the basis for some very useful information.

Just remember that there are a lot of different sized monitors in circulation so some customers may still see a jump when changing pages unless all pages on your site are the same length.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">Can I moderate the posts on my Website blog?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>Yes you can.

The organisation that manages this database is called a registry.

For example under the sales@myname mailbox you could have the names of your sales team e.g. john@, susi@, josh@ all of which would redirect to your sales department. Take note - all addresses must be unique.</p> <p><strong>Email Client</strong>: Another name for an application that allows you to access and manage your emails on your computer. These include MS Outlook, Mac Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, Eudora and Opera Mail. To use these clients you need to set up your incoming and outgoing services e.g. POP, IMAP, SMTP.</p> <p><strong>Mail Forwarding</strong>: This means that you won't have a mailbox for receiving or sending mail and any mail sent to your new email address will not be stored on the server but redirected or forwarded to the email address you want to access it from, e.g. me@mydomainname.com > me@gmail.com.</p> <p><strong>Mailbox</strong>: This is an account you create using your domain name which allows you to view, save and send emails from. You can access your mailbox using webmail or by using an email client like Outlook, Mac Mail, Thunderbird etc. The mailbox name must be used as the username to login to it.</p> <p><strong>Webmail</strong>: This means accessing your email online without email software on your computer. The most common examples are Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo, although our webmail also lets you access your mail over the internet.</p>                    </dd>                    <dt class="expandable clickablequestion hidden">Why is the &quot;/_app&quot; folder showing up in Google?<span class="more"></span></dt>                    <dd class="answer">                        <p>We apply a standard (recommended) robots.txt file to our sites - for example, mysite.com/robots.txt.</p><p>The content of the robots.txt file requests that bots (search engine robots that explore and read each website) ignore two of our directories: the "_app" and "cgi-bin" directories.</p><p>Specifically, the robots.txt file contains the following instructions:</p><code><ul type="none">	<li>User-agent: *</li>	<li>Disallow: /_app/</li>	<li>Disallow: /cgi-bin/</li></ul></code><p>In our experience this does not negatively impact SEO, even though you may get some advisory warnings from Google (who themselves will suggest that this may not be an issue).
